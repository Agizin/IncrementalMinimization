OVERVIEW

  This distribution contains workloads used to drive the Pattern
  Matching Engine (PME) of the PowerEN processor.  Each workload
  consist of:

    *  A set of regular expression patterns
    *  A set of search traces

  The patterns represent the patterns searched for.  The search traces
  represent the data to be searched.

DIRECTORY HIERARCHY

  ./simple  :  Simple patterns - all fixed strings.
  ./cmplex  :  More complex regular expressions.

  ./(simple|cmplex)/single_ctx :  All patterns in one contex.
  ./(simple|cmplex)/multi_ctx  :  Multiple contexts, each with 1000 patterns.

  ./(simple|cmplex)/(single_ctx|multi_ctx)/patterns : *.pat pattern files.
  ./(simple|cmplex)/(single_ctx|multi_ctx)/traces   : *.strace.gz compressed
                                                      search trace files

PATTERN FILE FORMAT

  The *.pat file format is fairly straightforward.  Patterns use only
  normal well-understood regular expression syntax.

  Some pattern files use the Options keyword.

    Option s   :   "." construct matches any character, rather than any 
                   character other than carriage-return and line-feed.

    Option i   :   Case-insensitive pattern

SEARCH TRACE FORMAT

  The *.strace.gz files are (when uncompressed) a simple ASCII readable
  format.  See ./Search_Trace_Format.txt for details.

  The search traces provided here do not use many of the features of the
  full trace format, as described in Search_Trace_Format.txt.
