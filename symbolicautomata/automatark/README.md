# AutomatArk (Automata Benchmark)
The goal of this project is to collect benchmark problems for different models of automata, transducers, and related logics.
This will allow to have standardized sets of benchmarks for research in these topics.


##Input Format
The file formats of each model are described in the readme file of the corresponding folder.
We also provide parsers for LTL and tree automata. We are working on building more.
